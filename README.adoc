A tool to generate well-defined, but essentially random, input following the
idea of constrained non-determinism.

== Getting started

Include the following dependency in your `build.gradle.kts` file:

[source,kotlin]
._build.gradle.kts_
----
testImplementation("com.appmattus.fixture:fixture:<latest-version>")
----

Simply create a fixture and invoke it with the type to be generated:

[source,kotlin]
----
val fixture = kotlinFixture()

// Generate a list of strings
val aListOfStrings = fixture<List<String>>()

// Nulls are supported
val sometimesNull = fixture<Int?>()

// Create instances of classes
// Optional parameters will be randomly used or overridden
data class ADataClass(val value: String = "default")
val aClass = fixture<ADataClass>()

// Abstract classes will pick a sub-class at random
// This could be a Byte, Double, Long, Float, Int or Short
val anyNumber = fixture<Number>()

// Pick randomly from a list
val randomStringFromTheList = fixture(listOf("Cat", "Dog", "Horse"))
val anotherRandomIntFromAList = fixture(1..5)
----

You can also generate an infinite sequence of a type, which you can then
filter:

[source,kotlin]
----
val fixture = kotlinFixture()

val intSequence = fixture.asSequence<Int>()

// Standard Kotlin sequence functions can then be applied before using
// the sequence through an iterator for access to the next() function.

// For example, you can filter values
val oddIterator = intSequence.filter { it.absoluteValue.rem(2) == 1 }.iterator()
val oddNumber = oddIterator.next()
val anotherOddNumber = oddIterator.next()

// Or, ensure it returns only distinct values
enum class XYZ { X, Y, Z }
val enumIterator = fixture.asSequence<XYZ>().distinct().iterator()
val aDistinctValue = enumIterator.next()
val anotherDistinctValue = enumIterator.next()
----

[WARNING]
====
The sequence can hang indefinitely if the applied operators prevent the generation of new values. For example:

* `distinct` will hang if we exhaust all available values. A good practice is to add a `take(count)` which will throw a `NoSuchElementException` if we try to generate more values.
* `filter` that can never be fulfilled e.g. `filter { false }`
====

== Configuration options

Everything can be customised, see link:fixture/configuration-options.adoc[configuration options] for more details.

== Kotest integration: property based testing

The library provides {link-appmattus} powered property based testing for https://github.com/kotest/kotest/[Kotest].

See link:fixture-kotest/README.adoc[Kotest integration] for more details.

== Java Faker integration: pretty data

Generate values with a closer match to real data using http://dius.github.io/java-faker/[Java Faker].

See link:fixture-javafaker/README.adoc[Java Faker integration] for more details.

== Generex integration: regex to random string

To generate a random string from a Regex, look no further than the Generex integration.

See link:fixture-generex/README.adoc[Generex integration] for more details.
