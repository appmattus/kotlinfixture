// Add for Kotest integration
testImplementation("com.appmattus.fixture:fixture-kotest:<latest-version>")

https://github.com/kotest/kotest/[Kotest] supports
https://github.com/kotest/kotest/blob/master/doc/reference.md#property-based-testing-[property testing],
but to use it with more than just the few basic types built
into the library requires you to create your own custom generators which
you then provide.

Including the `fixture-kotest` dependency in your project adds extension
functions `checkAll` and `forAll` to the fixture. These
functions wrap the equivalent functions from Kotest while providing
generation of all the classes
https://github.com/appmattus/kotlinfixture[KotlinFixture] supports.
For example:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class Person(name: String, age: Int)

fixture.checkAll { person1: Person, person2: Person ->
   person1 shouldNotBeSameInstanceAs person2
}
