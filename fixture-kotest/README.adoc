== Kotest support

[source,kotlin]
----
// Add for Kotest integration
testImplementation("com.appmattus.fixture:fixture-kotest:<latest-version>")
----

https://github.com/kotest/kotest/[Kotest] supports
https://github.com/kotest/kotest/blob/master/doc/reference.md#property-based-testing-[property testing],
but to use it with more than just the few basic types that are built
into the library requires you to create your own custom generators that
you then have to provide.

Including the `fixture-kotest` dependency in your project adds extension
functions `checkAll` and `forAll` to the fixture. These
functions wrap the equivalent functions from Kotest while providing
generation of all the classes
https://github.com/appmattus/kotlinfixture[KotlinFixture] supports.
For example:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class Person(name: String, age: Int)

fixture.checkAll { person1: Person, person2: Person ->
   person1 shouldNotBeSameInstanceAs person2
}
