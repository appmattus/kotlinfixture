While the main link:configuration-options.adoc[configuration options] should
handle the majority of ways to alter how {link-appmattus} generates fixtures,
perhaps there is core functionality missing, or some other reason where you
need finer grained control.

Of course, we would love to hear about it, to help us improve {link-appmattus}
so please also consider raising link:https://github.com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/issues[issues]
and creating link:https://github.com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/pulls[PRs].

== Generators

While `factory` and `property` generators have built-in helper functions
you can also create your own by adding extension functions to `link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/config/Generator.kt[Generator]`.

`link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/config/Generator.kt[Generator]`
provides `random` for you to use which can be seeded in your fixture
definition.

You also have access to `fixture` for internally generating other classes.

[source,kotlin]
----
fun Generator<Int>.odd(max: Int = Int.MAX_VALUE): Int  = random.nextInt(max).let {
    it + if (it % 2 == 0) 1 else 0
}

data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

fun Generator<Person>.person(child: Boolean): Person = Person(
    name = fixture<String>(),
    age = if (child) random.nextInt(random.nextInt(0, 17)) else random.nextInt(18, 95)
)
----

== Resolvers

The core engine of {link-appmattus} is based on a chain of `{url-resolver}[Resolver]` instances
which are queried in sequence. We ask each `{url-resolver}[Resolver]`
if it handles the current input object, and it returns either a generated fixture or `link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/Unresolved.kt[Unresolved.Unhandled]`.

NOTE: We use link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/Unresolved.kt[Unresolved] as nulls are valid fixtures.

The `{url-resolver}[Resolver]` interface requires the implementation of the `resolve` function:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun resolve(context: Context, obj: Any): Any?
----

Typically, the input object, `obj`, begins as a `KType` and as it passes
through the resolver chain will be changed to new values, such as a `KClass`.
A recursive call to `context.resolve(…)` is made with this new value for
another `{url-resolver}[Resolver]` to pick up.

When generating random content, use `context.random` to retain the ability to link:configuration-options.adoc#_providing_a_seeded_random[provide a seeded `random`].

== Decorators

On the other hand, a `{url-decorator}[Decorator]` allows you to intercept and
modify the `{url-resolver}[Resolver]` chain and are currently being used for functionality from
link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/decorator/logging/LoggingDecorator.kt[logging]
to link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/decorator/recursion/RecursionDecorator.kt[recursion].

== Strategies

To customise the behaviour of a `{url-resolver}[Resolver]` or
`{url-decorator}[Decorator]`, a strategy can be provided in the configuration,
and retrieved using `context.strategyOrDefault(…)`.

For convenience, we add an extension function to the link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/config/ConfigurationBuilder.kt[ConfigurationBuilder].
For example, see link:src/main/kotlin/com/appmattus/kotlinfixture/decorator/logging/LoggingConfiguration.kt[LoggingConfiguration].
