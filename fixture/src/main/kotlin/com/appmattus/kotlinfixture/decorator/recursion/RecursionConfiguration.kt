/**
 * Changing how recursion behaves with `recursionStrategy`
 *
 * When the library detects recursion, by default, it will throw an [UnsupportedOperationException] with the details of the circular reference. This strategy can be changed to instead return `null` for the reference, however, if this results in an invalid object an exception will still be thrown as the object requested couldnâ€™t be resolved.
 *
 * ```
 * val fixture = kotlinFixture {
 *     recursionStrategy(NullRecursionStrategy)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Available strategies
 *
 * - [NullRecursionStrategy] use null for circular references.
 * - [ThrowingRecursionStrategy] throw an exception when finding circular references.
 * - [UnresolvedRecursionStrategy] use Unresolved for circular references, which may result in generation of a valid object as other scenarios will be tried
 *
 * It is also possible to define and implement your own recursion strategy by implementing [RecursionStrategy] and applying it as above.
