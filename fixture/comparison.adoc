Before writing {link-appmattus} we
originally looked to extend {link-flextrade},
however, as the core project is Java based we struggled with the type system
and so {link-appmattus} was born.

Being Java based means {link-easyrandom} and {link-flextrade}
will never be able to understand Kotlin's https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#nullable-types-and-non-null-types[nullable types].
Currently {link-marcellogalhardo} also doesn't support nullable types, although this functionality could be added.

Unlike {link-appmattus}, the other libraries have no understanding of Kotlin's
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#default-arguments[default values]
which can mean missing an important test scenario.

Only {link-appmattus} has built-in support for abstract classes. Kotlin's https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html[sealed classes]
are abstract so not supported, with only {link-marcellogalhardo} supporting sealed classes but not abstract classes.

For ease of use, a fixture library needs good support for build-in types to
reduce the amount of customisation required.


One of our frustrations when we previously used {link-flextrade} was because of
