Before writing {link-appmattus}, we originally looked to extend
{link-flextrade}, however, as the core project is Java based we struggled with
the type system, and so we started work on {link-appmattus}.

Being Java based means {link-easyrandom} and {link-flextrade} will never be
able to understand Kotlin's https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#nullable-types-and-non-null-types[nullable types].
Currently {link-marcellogalhardo}, which is Kotlin based, doesn't support
nullable types either, although this functionality could be added.

Unlike {link-appmattus}, the other libraries have no understanding of Kotlin's
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#default-arguments[default values]
which can mean missing an important test scenario.

Only {link-appmattus} has built-in support for abstract classes. Kotlin's https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html[sealed classes]
are abstract so not supported, with only {link-marcellogalhardo} supporting
sealed classes but not abstract classes.

For ease of use, a fixture library needs good support for built-in types to
reduce the amount of customisation required, whether that is types such as
Kotlin's `https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-pair/[Pair]`,
Java types such as `Currency` and `Locale` or even Java 8s time types. The user
should expect them to seamlessly work with no additional configuration.

Needless to say all software has bugs, we have tried hard to ensure we create
core types as expected, and hopefully have enough tests to back that up.
However, when comparing our library to our competitors we did find
various unsupported types, not random, or generated invalid types. For example:

- {link-flextrade} does not support `Pair`, `Triple`, `Currency` or `Locale`.
- `HashMap` is not random in any of the competitors.
- `SortedSet` and `SortedMap` generate invalid objects in {link-flextrade}.
- Various `List` types either generate invalid objects or aren't random in {link-easyrandom}.
- {link-marcellogalhardo} doesn't support primitive arrays such as `ByteArray` and `IntArray`.
